Py City Schools Observations

1)	The Charter Schools appear to perform much better than the District Schools in all measured 
	categories.
2)	Schools with less than 2000 students perform much better than the schools with greater than 
	2000 students. There appears to be little difference between the schools with 1000-2000 
	students and students with less than 1000 students.
3)	The spending per student appears to have little impact on the students passing or failing. Oddly, 
	the data shows that the less spent per student, the better performance of the students.
